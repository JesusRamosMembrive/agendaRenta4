## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT

Before ANY work, read in this order:
1. .claude/00-project-brief.md - Project scope and constraints
2. .claude/01-current-phase.md - Current state and progress
3. .claude/02-stage[X]-rules.md - Rules for current stage

## 📝 SESSION WORKFLOW

⚠️ MANDATORY: At the START of EVERY session, BEFORE responding to user:

1. **ALWAYS read these files first** (use Read tool in parallel):
   - .claude/00-project-brief.md - Project scope and constraints
   - .claude/01-current-phase.md - Current state and progress
   - .claude/02-stage[X]-rules.md - Rules for current stage

2. **ALWAYS confirm to user** you've read the context:
   - State current phase/stage
   - Summarize what was last done
   - Ask for clarification if anything is unclear

3. **ONLY THEN** respond to the user's request

**This applies EVEN IF the user's first message is a simple question.**
Do NOT skip this protocol to "be helpful faster" - reading context IS being helpful.

During WORK:
- Follow stage-specific rules strictly
- Propose plans before implementing
- Get approval for architectural decisions

At END of session:
- Update .claude/01-current-phase.md with:
  * What was implemented (with file names)
  * Decisions made and why
  * What was NOT done (deferred)
  * Next steps for next session
- Keep 01-current-phase.md concise and scannable

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

- Never implement without reading current context
- Never skip updating progress at end of session
- Never assume you remember from previous sessions
- Always check current stage rules before proposing solutions

## 🚫 NEVER

- Over-engineer beyond current stage
- Implement features not in project brief
- Skip the "propose then implement" workflow
- Forget to update tracking

## 📚 PROJECT RESOURCES

Available in `docs/` folder:
- **PROMPT_LIBRARY.md** - Templates for common situations (debugging, refactoring, etc.)
- **QUICK_START.md** - Workflow guide
- **STAGES_COMPARISON.md** - Quick reference table
- **CLAUDE_CODE_REFERENCE.md** - Claude Code tips, slash commands, MCP, subagents

Use these resources when stuck or making decisions.

## 💡 REMEMBER

- Simplicity > Completeness
- Solve today's problems, not tomorrow's
- The methodology matters more than the code
- When in doubt, check the stage rules
